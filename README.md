# Description:
Once is quite boring to type "gcc -o output progName.c" everytime you need to compile a C program, a made this program that allows you to compile a C program using only its name as an argument. You can also specify the output name, if you want to.

# How to run it?
To run the program you just need to type the command "./.mcc progName.c output", where: "mcc" is my program name; "progName" is the name of your C source code; and, if you want, you can specify a output as you wish.
